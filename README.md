## Reflection

1.  How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

Arguments are optionally passed to functions when invoked; functions are optionally written with parameters similarly to variables in algebra.  No parameters, no variables, then functionality's quite limited, quite inflexible.

2.  What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

Typos or conceptualizing control flow were the limit of challenges I encountered during this assignment.  Nothing to mention, really.

3.  How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

Technically, refactoring isn't just about improving O(n).  In practice, though, if it works and is as fast as can be, then no reason to change it - ideally.

I think it's best to have a very good idea of naming practices and data structures being used, and of how the programs and algorithms will be structured, so refactoring need not be done to increase readability and maintainability in the first place.  That said, different programmers have different factors, and sometimes it's necessary and appropriate to go back through code to improve readability and maintainability.
